This project aims to generate images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with scene graphs as input. Scene graphs are a useful way of organizing the logical and spatial representation of objects, their relationships, qualities, and spatial layouts in a graphical scene. The project focuses on exploring the use of scene graphs in image generation and evaluating the performance of GANs on this task. The goal is to generate images that preserve the composition of the original image, including objects, qualities, relationships, and spatial layouts. This approach increases control, semantic comprehension, effectiveness, and variety of the generated images. By feeding scene graphs into GANs, the researchers aim to enhance the capabilities of GANs in generating images.
